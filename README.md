This project sheds light on the significance of machine learning in solving real-world economic problems. The project applies and compares the performance of sentiment analysis models like VADER, Roberta, and the Hugging Face Pipeline (Transformers) to identify which approach is most effective in capturing sentiment nuances. Comprehending the pros and cons of these models is crucial for businesses that want to understand customer preferences better. This project addresses an economic question relevant to large-scale e-commerce businesses and analyzes and provides practical insights that could benefit small business owners. It underscores the importance of sentiment analysis as a valuable decision-making tool in the food industry, particularly baking and confectionary products.

### Problem Statement
Customer satisfaction is a critical factor for purchasing decisions in the e-commerce industry. Sentiment analysis gives businesses actionable insights by interpreting customer opinions in product reviews. E-commerce platforms like Amazon have transformed how customers interact with products and provide feedback. Online reviews reflect individual purchasing choices essential to a brand's overall reputation. Customers' opinions regarding taste, freshness, and presentation in the bakery business significantly impact purchasing decisions.
Traditional sales data generally does not capture qualitative insights that customer reviews express.
Considering this, this project aims to answer the following:
#### "How does sentiment analysis of customer reviews influence market strategies, product development, and pricing decisions for both large e-commerce platforms like Amazon and small businesses in the food industry?"
Let's break this down into more specific questions:
1.	What are the consumer sentiments towards bakery & confectionery products on Amazon, and how do these sentiments affect market demand and pricing strategies?
2.	To what extent do different sentiment analysis models impact the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of identifying consumer preferences in the bakery & confectionery products market?
3.	How can insights from sentiment analysis inform strategic decisions in the food industry, such as product development, pricing, and competitive positioning?

### Background
The problem statement is particularly important to me as my mother runs a small home-based baking business. Customer sentiment has always been a key part of her business decisions to refine product offerings and set competitive prices.
However, like many small businesses, due to small scale operations she lacks extensive data to run a comprehensive sentiment analysis on. While customer feedback can be collected, the limited volume of reviews makes it challenging to apply machine learning techniques effectively.
To overcome this limitation, the Amazon Fine Foods Reviews dataset was a good substitute as it offers a comprehensive collection of customer reviews from Amazon, a large-scale e-commerce platform. A sentiment analysis of bakery product reviews from this dataset can help mimic what a small business might face if they had access to more extensive customer feedback. This project offers important takeaways on how sentiment analysis helps to make informed decisions, optimize product quality, and enhance customer satisfaction.
Sentiment analysis helps businesses to:
•	Identify major pain points of customers.
•	Track shifts in customer preferences over time.
•	Plan real-time strategies to boost the business.
This makes it an essential tool, in the competitive online market, for bakery businesses, both large and small, to efficiently meet consumer demand.
